/* fsr3.h: AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 3.1.6, the temporal upscaler, as MVEX on the card, for one grey camera, and what the user ordered around it, 2026-11-04: FSR first, on real frames only, straight to the size shown, then the flow doubles the finished
 * pictures. Camera D: 720p15, 1080p15, 1080p30. A second stage down by Lanczos remains for a larger upscale.
 *
 * Passes, as the shaders have them: the luma, the shading change (sorted 5-sample sets, a pyramid of three mips), reactivity and accumulation, luma instability, the accumulate pass (history reprojected through a Lanczos 2 sampler with
 * deringing, a Lanczos of the new frame, a rectification box, thin-feature locks), RCAS with its denoise. Everything a shader computes per pixel and a camera makes constant is computed once:
 *   grey       Co and Cg are zero, so one channel; the box clamp in YCoCg space is a clamp on an interval
 *   exposure   1; no pre-exposure change; no HDR tonemap
 *   jitter     0: fixed cameras cannot have any. So not the shader's narrow 3 x 3 slice of each frame, which only jitter fills in: the whole Lanczos 2 over 4 x 4, with the first sample of a pixel taken from it and not from the box. On a still pixel
 *              this is a temporal denoiser over a spatial upscale, not a gain in detail
 *   motion     one vector for each 16 x 16 block, from AMD's optical flow of the two frames, refined below a pixel by one Lucas-Kanade step: no gather. A still block reads its history directly
 *   depth      none exists at this rate. A moving block stands for near and a still one for far: disocclusion is a still block under where a moving block was, what FSR's reconstructed depth finds with a real depth buffer
 *   reactive   one value a block, from how the motion field diverges
 * Lanes of the output cannot use gather either: 16 output columns span under 16 source columns, so a permute with a table made at the start fetches them. Each source row is filtered across once, and an output row mixes four of them.
 * Nothing invented enters the history: generated frames are made afterwards, from the finished pictures, by the middle vectors the flow found between the two raw frames. FSR needs its motion before it runs, so the search itself cannot come after it. history_steps says how far back the history lies in steps of the field, more than one when frames were let go.
 *
 * Every stage takes (tid, n): a team may run it in parts, and the answer does not depend on how many threads. The same source is native MVEX on the card and a bit-exact model on the host.
